# ðŸ”¥ Energy-guided Optimal Transport

This project contains experiments related to training energy-based model guided by optimal transport to learn joint plan $\pi_\theta(x, y)$, which allows to sample conditionally both from $\pi_\theta(x|y)$ and $\pi_\theta(y|x)$ as a result of training on the fly.
